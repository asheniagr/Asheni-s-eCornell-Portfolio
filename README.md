This project aims to predict Airbnb listing prices using a combination of review scores, property characteristics, 
and location data. After cleaning and preprocessing the data—such as scaling numerical features and encoding 
categorical variables—two regression models, Linear Regression and Random Forest, are trained to estimate listing 
prices. The models are evaluated using metrics like RMSE and R², with visualizations illustrating predicted versus 
actual prices and residual errors. Additionally, the project explores price categorization by grouping listings into 
low, medium, and high price ranges, training a Random Forest classifier to predict these categories and evaluating its 
performance through a confusion matrix. Overall, the project provides insights into the factors influencing Airbnb 
prices and demonstrates methods for both price estimation and classification.
